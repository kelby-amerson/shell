We did a great job pair programming. 

We both completed our commitments well and a few days before the project due date.

To compile:

Type: $ make

        This will generate executables for all .cpp files in our project.
        You can also compile individual programs.

To run:

Type: $./main

	This opens up the shell. Every command you type in the shell can take up to 9 arguments.

To clean:

Type: $ make clean
